Dimensionality reduction refers to the reduction of data from n-dimension to k-dimension where n<k. A dataset with large number of input variables (dimensions) 
make the predicting model very complex and might not fit the model efficiently which is commonly referred to as curse of dimensionality. Dimension reduction 
techniques are used to reduce the dimensions of the input data and usually we choose k in such a way that 99% of variance is retained. That means the structure 
and relationships of the variables of data is retained with less number of dimension than before. 

Dimensionality reduction is generally used for data compression and data visualisation.

Principal Component Analysis is one of the popular dimensionality reduction technique.
Also there are other techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), t-distributed Stochasic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) etc.
